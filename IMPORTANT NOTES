IMPORTANT NOTES
	- a "state" is 88 bytes, not 80
		- includes a todHI, todLO and whatever else is in the booklet
	- device register area is completely different
	- line 2 is the timer interrupt
	- timer interrupts are interpreted as fast interrupts
		- disabling FIQ disables interval timer but not other devices
	- all other interrupts are interpreted as slower interrupts
		- disabling IRQ disables all devices except interval timer
		
		
	- IS THERE NO QUANTUM TIMER
	
	
	
	check time to next pseudo clock tick when scheduling
	when interrupts happens, you add the time passed to the job's time
	subtract it from next pseudo clock tick
	
	when loading timer, which is lower
			quantum or pseudo clock time?
